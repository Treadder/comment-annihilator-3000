## 💥 Comment Annihilator 3000 💥

![VsCodeListing.png](VsCodeListing.png)

This extension provides a powerful, single-command utility to aggressively remove **single-line** and **multi-line** comments from your active file, followed by blank line cleanup. The idea is to reduce the time we spend saying, "_Hey AI get rid of these comments_", because this is way more efficient. I wrote an article about it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-built-tool-do-something-ai-already-does-seconds-heres-kelnhofer-pqyoc).

### ✨ Features & Supported Languages

- **Fast and Local:** Comment Annihilator 3000 uses fast regex logic to find and remove comments across the entire document.
- **Aggressive Removal:** Comments are replaced with an **empty string**.
- **Blank Line Cleanup:** After comment removal, all occurrences of **two or more consecutive blank lines** are condensed down to one, and any blank lines at the start of the file are removed.

### 🚀 Usage

1.  Open the file you wish to clean.
2.  Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3.  Search for: `Annihilate Comments`
4.  Execute the command. Your file is instantly cleaned!
5.  Pro tip: if you use the command a lot, it's as fast as `Ctrl+Shift+P+Enter` as your most-used commands are automaticall suggested by VS Code.

### Limitations

1.  **Multiline Comment Formatting:** Expects your multiline comments to be formatted properly. If you have an unterminated `/*` (or `"""`) in a file, you might get wonky results when running this.
2.  **String wierdness:** There's bound to be edge cases with URL strings, etc. Feel free to open a PR or email me if you find a bug!
