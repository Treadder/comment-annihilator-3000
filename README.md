# 💥 Comment Annihilator 3000 💥

## Clean Code, Zero Effort.

This extension provides a powerful, single-command utility to aggressively **remove all single-line comments (`//`)** from your active file, ensuring your code remains clean and compact.

---

### ✨ Features

The Annihilator uses precise regex logic to handle two scenarios flawlessly:

- **Full-Line Comment Removal:** If a line contains only a comment (with optional indentation), the entire line is deleted, collapsing the space.

  - **Before:**
    ```javascript
    // This entire line will vanish
    var x = 1;
    ```
  - **After:**
    ```javascript
    var x = 1;
    ```

- **Inline Comment Deletion:** If a line contains code followed by a comment, only the comment (and the preceding whitespace) is removed. The code and its line break are preserved.

  - **Before:**
    ```javascript
    var x = 1; // This part is deleted
    ```
  - **After:**
    ```javascript
    var x = 1;
    ```

- **URL Protection:** The extension will **never remove `//`** if it is preceded by a colon (`:`), protecting links in your code like `https://example.com//path`.

### 🚀 Usage

1.  Open the file you wish to clean.
2.  Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3.  Search for: `Annihilate All Single-Line Comments (Excluding URLs)`
4.  Execute the command. Your file is instantly cleaned!

### Limitations

1. Expects your multiline comments to be formatted properly. If you have an unterminated `/*` in a C# file you might get wonky results when running this.
